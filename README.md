# Peanut Labs Reward Center - Publisher iOS SDK

Peanut Labs connects your users with thousands of paid online surveys from big brands and market researchers. This SDK allows you to integrate our Reward Center within your iOS application. 

# The Reward Center

The Reward Center lists surveys and offers best suited for each of your members. It is highly customizable and positively engaging.

You get paid whenever your members complete a listing, and get to reward them back in the virtual currency of your choice.

All of this and much more is configured  and monitored through our Publisher Dashboard. To learn more and get access to our full set of tools, get in touch with us at publisher.integration@peanutlabs.com
